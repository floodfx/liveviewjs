# Gratitude

ðŸ™Œ Thanks to the Phoenix LiveView team for the genius conceptualization and implementation of LiveViews and all the code
we can reuse on the client side.

ðŸ™Œ Thanks to [@ogrodnek](https://github.com/ogrodnek) for the early support, feedback, and the idea to reuse the Phoenix
client code instead of reinventing!

ðŸ™Œ Thanks to [@blimmer](https://github.com/blimmer/) for the awesome feedback, documentation suggestions, and support!
