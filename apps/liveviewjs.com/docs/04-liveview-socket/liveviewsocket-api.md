# LiveViewSocket API

The `LiveViewSocket` API is the second most important API (behind the LiveView API itself). As you've seen, the
`LiveViewSocket` is passed into (as the `socket` param) just about all of the LiveView API methods (excluding `render`).
So far we've mainly used it to update the context of the LiveView. But there is a lot more to `LiveViewSocket` and in
this section we'll review the full API.

## LiveViewSocket Properties and Methods

| Name                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Typically used to ensure large but infrequently updated values are not kept in memory.                                                                                                   |

Requires using the `live_title` helper in rendering the page.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Requires a client `Hook` to be defined and to be listening for the event via `this.handleEvent` callback.                                                                                                                                         |

| `pushRedirect(path: string, params?: URLSearchParams, replaceHistory?: boolean): Promise<void>;`                                       | Shutdowns the current LiveView and loads another LiveView in its place without reloading the whole page (i.e.,  making a full HTTP request). Can be used to remount the current LiveView if need be. Use `pushPatch` to update the current LiveView without unloading and remounting.              |

Events published to this topic will be delivered to `handleInfo`.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `consumeUploadedEntries<T>(configName: string,fn: (meta: ConsumeUploadedEntriesMeta, entry: UploadEntry) => Promise<T>):Promise<T[]>;` | Consume the uploaded files for a given UploadConfig (by name). This should only be called after the form's "save" event has occurred which guarantees all the files for the upload have been fully uploaded.                                                                                     |
| `uploadedEntries(configName: string): Promise<{completed: UploadEntry[];inProgress: UploadEntry[];}>;`                                 | Returns two sets of files that are being uploaded, those `completed` and those `inProgress` for a given UploadConfig (by name). Unlike `consumeUploadedEntries`, this does not require the form's "save" event to have occurred and will not throw if any of the entries are not fully uploaded. |

## Related Parts of the API

We'll look at related parts of the `LiveViewSocket` API over the next few sections:

- Reading and Writing the Context
- Pushing Updates to the Client
- Server Events / Pub/Sub
- File Uploads
- Everything Else
