# Deno - Build a LiveView

Since you've already [downloaded the **LiveViewJS** repo](get-liveviewjs-repo), it should be easy to create a new
LiveView and add it to your webserver. Let's get started!

## Create a new LiveView in Deno

Since we are using Deno to serve our LiveViews, we'll create a new LiveView in the `packages/deno` directory.

Use your favorite editor to create a new file `packages/deno/src/example/liveview/hello.ts` and add the following code
and hit save:

```ts
import { createLiveView, html } from "liveviewjs";

export const helloLiveView = createLiveView({
  render: () => html`Hello World!`,
});
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first LiveView! It doesn't do much yet but let's get it running in the
browser.

## Setup a new Route

Let's add a route to this LiveView to see it in our browser. Edit `packages/deno/src/example/index.ts` and make
the following highlighted changes:

```ts title="packages/deno/src/example/index.ts" {3,7}
...
import { pageRenderer, rootRenderer } from "./liveViewRenderers.ts";
import { helloLiveView } from "./liveviews/hello.ts";

// map request paths to LiveViews
const lvRouter: LiveViewRouter = {
  "/hello": helloLiveView,
  "/autocomplete": autocompleteLiveView,
...
```

Great! We've now setup our new LiveView to be served at the `/hello` path. Let's start the server and see it in action.

## Start the Oak Server

Start up the Oak server in Deno:

```bash
# start oak server
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --import-map=import_map.json src/example/index.ts
```

## See the LiveView in Action

Point your browser to [http://localhost:9001/hello](http://localhost:9001/hello) and you should see something like the
following: ![LiveViewJS Hello World Screenshot](/img/screenshots/liveviewjs_hello_liveview_deno.png)

## Next Steps

Ok we got our first LiveView running but it isn't very interactive. Let's make it more interesting by adding a button
that toggles between using text and emojis to say hello. Update the `hello.ts` file to the following:

```ts title="packages/deno/src/example/liveview/hello.ts"
import { createLiveView, html } from "liveviewjs";

export const helloLiveView = createLiveView({
  mount: (socket) => {
    socket.assign({ useEmoji: false });
  },
  handleEvent(event, socket) {
    socket.assign({ useEmoji: !socket.context.useEmoji });
  },
  render: (context) => {
    const msg = context.useEmoji ? "ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ" : "Hello World";
    return html`
      ${msg}
      <br />
      <button phx-click="toggle">Toggle Message</button>
    `;
  },
});
```

Stop the Deno server and run the same command again to start the server.

Now, when you refresh the page, you should see a button that toggles between using text and emojis to say hello. It
should look something like this:

## Great start!

You've just created your first LiveView and added it to your webserver! There is a lot more to learn about
**LiveViewJS**, but you are well on your way. We recommend you continue to the
[Anatomy of a LiveView](/docs/category/anatomy-of-a-liveview) section to start to learn more about how LiveViews work.
