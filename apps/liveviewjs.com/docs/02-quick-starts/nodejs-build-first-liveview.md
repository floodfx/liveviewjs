# NodeJS - Build a LiveView

Since you've already [downloaded the **LiveViewJS** repo](get-liveviewjs-repo), it should be easy to create a new
LiveView and add it to your webserver. Let's get started!

## Create a new LiveView in Express

Since we are using Express to serve our LiveViews, we'll create a new LiveView in the `packages/express` directory.

Use your favorite editor to create a new file `packages/express/src/example/liveview/hello.ts` and add the following
code and hit save:

```ts
import { createLiveView, html } from "liveviewjs";

export const helloLiveView = createLiveView({
  render: () => html`Hello World!`,
});
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first LiveView! It doesn't do much yet but let's get it running in the
browser.

## Setup a new Route

Let's add a route to this LiveView to see it in our browser. Edit `packages/express/src/example/index.ts` and
make the following highlighted changes:

```ts title="packages/express/src/example/index.ts" {3,7}
...
import { htmlPageTemplate, wrapperTemplate } from "./liveViewRenderers";
import { helloLiveView } from "./liveview/hello";

// map request paths to LiveViews
const router: LiveViewRouter = {
  "/hello": helloLiveView,
  "/autocomplete": autocompleteLiveView,
...
```

Great! We've now setup our new LiveView to be served at the `/hello` path. Let's start the server and see it in action.

## Start the Express Server

First, load the NPM dependencies:

```bash
# install the NPM dependencies
npm install
```

Then, start the express server:

```bash
# start express server
npm run start -w packages/express
```

:::info You will probably see a warning from NodeJS about using an experimental feature:

```
ExperimentalWarning: The Fetch API is an experimental feature. This feature could change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

The feature we are using is the built-in `fetch` method. Feel free to ignore this warning. :::

## See the LiveView in Action

Point your browser to [http://localhost:4001/hello](http://localhost:4001/hello), and you should see something like the
following: ![LiveViewJS Hello World Screenshot](/img/screenshots/liveviewjs_hello_liveview.png)

## Next Steps

Ok, we got our first LiveView running but it isn't very interactive. Let's make it more interesting by adding a button
that toggles between using text and emojis to say hello. Update the `hello.ts` file to the following:

```ts title="packages/express/src/example/liveview/hello.ts"
import { createLiveView, html } from "liveviewjs";

export const helloLiveView = createLiveView({
  mount: (socket) => {
    socket.assign({ useEmoji: false });
  },
  handleEvent(event, socket) {
    socket.assign({ useEmoji: !socket.context.useEmoji });
  },
  render: (context) => {
    const msg = context.useEmoji ? "ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ" : "Hello World";
    return html`
      ${msg}
      <br />
      <button phx-click="toggle">Toggle Message</button>
    `;
  },
});
```

Now, when you refresh the page, you should see a button that toggles between using text and emojis to say hello. It
should look something like this:

:::info You'll notice that **LiveViewJS** automatically rebuilds and reloads the server when you make changes to your
LiveView code. This is a great way to iterate quickly on your LiveView. :::

## Great start!

You've just created your first LiveView and added it to your webserver! There is a lot more to learn about
**LiveViewJS** but you are well on your way. We recommend you continue to the
[Anatomy of a LiveView](/docs/category/anatomy-of-a-liveview) section to start to learn more about how LiveViews work.
